## How to Run on Linux

1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd IsAIti
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activateË†
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic python-dotenv google-genai
    ```

4. Start the server:
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app 
    ```
    - Server now will ask you to put a tcp server ip and port
    - Ensure the server is set to `0.0.0.0` to accept all incoming connections.
    - Add port number between 10000 and 14000.
    - Disable the firewall if needed.

## Running the Human Client

    - Ensure both devices are on the same network.
    - Provide the server IP and the port used as arguments.
